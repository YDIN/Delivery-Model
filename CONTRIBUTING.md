# How to contribute

The purpose of this project is to build and document a process for delivering YDIN client projects. 

As most the topics covered are very generic for most companies working in the professional services business, we keep this public and as a reference and an example for other companies too. Feel free to copy and/modify for your own purposes, but we're also willing and happy to take any helping hand to contribute and make this even more useful source of information. 

There are two ways to contribute to this project. First you can create issues through issues tab in GitHub or you can create a pull request from fork repository of yours.

General guideline is that if you have clear change that you think would organize or improve this documentation to be the best self branding guide then you should create a pull request. Describe in PR your reasonings for changes. Administrators of this repository are only ones to decide if you changes are taken in.

If you wish to initialize discussion or ponder about changes to this repository then easy place to start is the [issues page](https://github.com/YDIN/Delivery-Model/issues)

Thanks,

## Rules for creating issues

* Keep title clear and short enough. It should describe content as well as possible.
