# Client satisfaction survey

YDIN measures client satisfaction with a quick and simple "pulse survey" at the end of every sprint.

The survey is sent by email to the Product Owner with questions:

1. How satisfied have you been with the performance this sprint? (Scale 1-10)
2. Any feedback, comments? (Optional text field)

Results are stored in the project folder and available for Product Owner, Delivery Manager, and Account Manager.
